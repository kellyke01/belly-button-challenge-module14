In this module we looked at a dataset of belly button bacteria over a wide variety of people with different demographics. 
I first referenced the json file correctly in the javascript file. I was able to build the dashboard by using the d3.json to reference the json file.
I then populated the metadata for each different id to show up when clicked on.
The bar chart was then built by referencing the json and the data obtained from it.
I used otu_ids for the yticks and sample_values for the xvalues. I used a horizontal orientation for the bar chart and set up the layout.

for the bubble chart I took my built bar chart and got rid of the references to the yticks, xvalues and textlabels and turned it into a bubblechart.
I then set up the layout for the chart and then inserted it into the website.

I made sure each call function switced with each item change.
I then made sure to call the initial function and made sure it all showed up into the website.

in looking at this data I had no idea how much bacteria is housed in belly buttons. Seeing just how many different types there are was very interesting to me. I also could infer that majority of people HAVE a steady supply of bacteria located in their belly buttons. When looking at the data, I noticed most people have at least two different types of bacterias in rather large amounts in their belly buttons.
